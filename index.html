    <p>Hello, my name is Conner Hyndman. I was born in Ottawa, Ontario on March 4<sup>th</sup>. I currently in Russell, Ontario and still live with my family. I have three siblings and 2 dogs so my house is never quiet. I plan to move away when I am finally kicked out as I find it very lovely to not pay for my own groceries. My eldest brother is 23 years old and just moved out, so I have a few more years of free food.</p>

    <p>I enjoy playing a variety of sports. I lift weights a few times a week, I play volleyball on sunday and hockey during the winter. In fact, I am slightly <em>obsessed</em> with hockey. I am always up to date with the recent news from consuming at minimum three different hockey podcasts on top of watching the games.</p>
